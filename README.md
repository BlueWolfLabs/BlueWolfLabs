Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a cybersecurity and computer science student at Liberty University with a big heart for helping people and a curious mind that loves to learn and solve problems with code.
I am working toward a future in cybercrime investigation (in the FBI), and along the way, I've been enjoying tinkering with tech, creating content, and building stuff that makes life a little easier, or just cooler.
